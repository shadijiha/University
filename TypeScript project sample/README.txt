How to use this template:

1- Put all your TypeScript files (.ts) in the "src" folder.
2- Put the files you want to compile in the "priority.txt" and order them by priority.

NOTE: in the priority.txt file. INSERT ".js" after file name. E.g.: "sample.js"
NOTE: Seperate multiple files by a linebreak. Example:
"
firstFile.js
SecondFile.js
thirdFile.js
" 
3- Run "Compile_all.bat" to compile all files and then run "index.html"
