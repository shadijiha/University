	 *     {@code x}, {@code x.equals(x)} should return
	 *     {@code true}.
	 * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
	 *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
	 *     should return {@code true} if and only if
	 *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
	 * <li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
	 *     {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z}, if
	 *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and
	 *     {@code y.equals(z)} returns {@code true}, then
	 *     {@code x.equals(z)} should return {@code true}.
	 * <li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
	 *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
	 *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
	 *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no
	 *     information used in {@code equals} comparisons on the

	 * if {@code x} and {@code y} refer to the same object
	 * ({@code x == y} has the value {@code true}).

	 * method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
	 * general contract for the {@code hashCode} method, which states
	 * that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
	 *

	/**
	 * Creates and returns a copy of this object.  The precise meaning
	 * of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
	 * intent is that, for any object {@code x}, the expression:
	 * <blockquote>
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
	 * will be true, and that the expression:
	 * <blockquote>
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
	 * will be {@code true}, but these are not absolute requirements.
	 * While it is typically the case that:
	 * <blockquote>
	 * <pre>
	 * x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
	 * will be {@code true}, this is not an absolute requirement.
	 * <p>
	 * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
	 * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
	 * {@code Object}) obey this convention, it will be the case that
	 * {@code x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()}.
	 * <p>
	 * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
	 * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
	 * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
	 * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
	 * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
	 * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
	 * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
	 * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
	 * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
	 * need to be modified.
	 * <p>
	 * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
	 * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
	 * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
	 * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
	 * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
	 * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
	 * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
	 * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
	 * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
	 * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
	 * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
	 * performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
	 * <p>
	 * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
	 * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object
	 * whose class is {@code Object} will result in throwing an
	 * exception at run time.
	 *
	 * @return a clone of this instance.
	 * @throws CloneNotSupportedException if the object's class does not
	 *                                    support the {@code Cloneable} interface. Subclasses
	 *                                    that override the {@code clone} method can also
	 *                                    throw this exception to indicate that an instance cannot
	 *                                    be cloned.
